# Compatibility and CLI guide

This guide describes the behavior available to users today. The
[active plan](plans/2026-07-22-buildkite-gha.md) also contains implemented
internals, future product ideas, and deferred decisions; those are not support
promises unless they appear here.

## The current execution profile

The plugin and `upload` command use one fixed profile: `hosted-tokenless`.
It is designed for public code that can run without protected credentials on a
Linux x86-64 Buildkite Hosted Agent. Unsupported or privileged requests fail
before the generated jobs are uploaded.

There are three different compatibility claims:

1. **Compilable** — the workflow syntax and static job graph can be translated.
2. **Admitted** — action sources resolve and the generated plans satisfy the
   `hosted-tokenless` upload policy.
3. **Runtime-proven** — the repository's conformance or hosted test suite has
   executed that behavior successfully.

Compilation alone is not admission, and admission does not execute arbitrary
action code. In particular, an otherwise valid action may depend on a GitHub
artifact, token, OIDC, or noncanonical cache service that this project does not
provide.

## Support matrix

| Area | Production plugin | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux x86-64 host jobs | Supported | `ubuntu-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`, and `ubuntu-22.04` map to the fixed `hosted` queue. |
| Bash and `sh` steps | Supported | Includes environment and working-directory precedence. |
| Static job graphs and `needs` | Supported | Dependencies and logical results are preserved. |
| Static matrices | Supported | Includes typed values, `include`, `exclude`, and exact dependency fan-out. |
| Local reusable workflows | Supported when statically resolvable | Remote and runtime-dependent reusable workflows are deferred. |
| Job and step conditions | Supported subset | Syntax is checked, but not every runtime function or context limitation is preflighted. Some unsupported expressions fail only when the job runs. |
| Concurrent step controls | Supported | Includes `background`, `wait`, `wait-all`, `cancel`, and `parallel`. |
| JavaScript actions | Supported | Managed, digest-verified Node 20 and 24 runtimes are used. |
| Composite and local actions | Supported | Nested composites and global pre/main/post ordering are supported. |
| Anonymous public actions | Supported | Sources are resolved to immutable commits and complete trees are verified. |
| `actions/checkout` | Narrow support | Public `github.com` event repository, exact event SHA, workspace root, shallow credential-free fetch. |
| Dockerfile actions | Supported subset | Only compiler-verified local or anonymous public Dockerfile actions are admitted. |
| Step summaries | Supported | Published as job-scoped Buildkite annotations with a stable context. Requires Buildkite Agent v3.112 or newer. Oversized per-step summaries are skipped without failing the job; aggregate job summaries are bounded to 1 MiB. |
| Workflow commands | Supported subset | `::add-mask`, `::stop-commands`, `::warning`, and `::error` are supported. Warnings and errors retain title/file/range metadata and publish under separate, stable job-scoped contexts without changing step or job conclusions. Each aggregate is bounded to 1 MiB and requires Buildkite Agent v3.112 or newer for publication. `::notice`, groups, command echo control, and legacy commands are not supported. |
| `actions/upload-artifact` | Narrow support | The audited v4 commit supports bounded literal files/directories, ZIP compression levels, hidden-file selection, exact no-file behavior, and native Buildkite publication. See the explicit limits below. |
| `actions/download-artifact` | Narrow support | The audited v4.3.0 commit supports one exact literal name from verified direct `needs`, extracting directly to a clean workspace-relative path. |
| `actions/cache` | Experimental | Canonical root, restore, and save actions use the fixed Buildkite GitHub-Actions-compatible v2 results service on host jobs. See the constraints below. |
| Job and service containers | Not admitted | Implemented and runtime-proven, but still outside production `hosted-tokenless` policy. |
| `docker://` actions | Not supported | Private images, credentials, arbitrary options, volumes, and privileged containers are also rejected. |
| Broad artifact download modes | Not supported | Merge, IDs, patterns, all-artifact, cross-repository, and cross-run modes fail admission or input validation. |
| Private repositories or actions | Not supported | The preview has no private-source capability broker. |
| Secrets and provider tokens | Not supported | Includes `GITHUB_TOKEN`, GitHub App tokens, and protected environment grants. |
| OIDC | Not supported | GitHub-compatible and migration OIDC flows are deferred. |
| Windows and macOS | Not supported | Unmapped runner labels fail validation. |

## User-visible behavior

### Buildkite owns the run

No shadow GitHub Actions run is created. Workflow jobs and matrix entries are
visible as Buildkite jobs, with Buildkite scheduling, logs, cancellation,
retries, and status.

Actions steps remain inside one compatibility runtime because they share a
workspace, environment-file updates, action state, and cleanup lifecycle.
Docker is another execution backend within that job—not a security boundary
between mutually untrusted steps. Use a disposable job VM when workflow code
must be isolated from other jobs or the agent host.

Step summaries and workflow-command warnings/errors are visibility-only
Buildkite annotations. Their publication is attempted after the authoritative
logical result; an annotation API failure is reported as a warning but does not
rewrite an otherwise successful job. Successfully parsed warning/error command
lines are consumed and their decoded messages remain visible in the job log.

### Concurrent steps stay inside the job

Background and parallel work use a bounded, ten-active-step supervisor rather
than creating more Buildkite jobs. For example:

```yaml
steps:
  - id: lint
    run: ./scripts/lint
    background: true

  - id: test
    run: ./scripts/test
    background: true

  - wait-all:
```

A background step's outputs, environment changes, and failures become visible
at the covering `wait` or `wait-all`. Remaining work is joined by an implicit
final `wait-all` before post-action cleanup. Use `cancel: <step-id>` for targeted
cancellation or `parallel:` for a fixed inline group. These controls preserve
one job workspace and lifecycle.

### Buildkite owns triggers

Select the workflow explicitly in the plugin and configure pipeline triggers in
Buildkite. `buildkite-gha` uses the event snapshot to populate Actions contexts;
it does not subscribe to GitHub events or turn workflow `on:` entries into
Buildkite triggers.

The plugin derives `pull_request` for Buildkite pull request builds and `push`
for branch, tag, scheduled, and manual builds. It does not currently provide
`schedule` or `workflow_dispatch` contexts or dispatch inputs. A scheduled or
manual trigger is therefore compatible only when the workflow expects push
semantics. The direct CLI accepts explicit event snapshots as documented below,
but the plugin does not expose that option yet.

For pull requests, the plugin uses the exact Buildkite commit and a
`refs/pull/<number>/head` compatibility ref. It does not claim GitHub's merge-ref
semantics when Buildkite has not supplied them.

### Checkout starts clean

Generated jobs skip Buildkite's default checkout and allocate a fresh Actions
workspace. A supported `actions/checkout` step performs a credential-free,
shallow checkout of the public event repository at the exact event SHA. Private
checkout, alternate repositories or refs, and credential persistence are not
available in the preview.

### Artifact uploads use bounded native storage

The producer-side adapter recognizes only
`actions/upload-artifact@ea165f8d65b6e75b540449e92b4886f43607fa02`.
It verifies that immutable action source and metadata, then replaces the whole
upstream JavaScript lifecycle with a Buildkite Agent artifact upload. A mutable
v4 reference is accepted only when resolution produces that audited commit.

The supported inputs are `name`, `path`, `if-no-files-found`,
`include-hidden-files`, `compression-level`, explicit `overwrite: false`, and
explicit `archive: true`. `path` accepts at most 32 clean, workspace-relative,
newline-separated literal files or directories. Globs, exclusions, path
expressions, symlinks, non-regular files, more than 10,000 selected files, more
than 1 GiB of source or archive bytes, retention controls, overwrite, and raw
uploads fail explicitly. Hidden path segments are excluded by default.

The action exposes `artifact-id` as an opaque positive decimal adapter identity
and `artifact-digest` as the bare SHA-256 of the stored ZIP, matching the useful
shape of the upstream outputs. `artifact-url` is not fabricated because a
GitHub run-scoped URL does not exist. The authoritative terminal result binds
the ID and digest to the native Buildkite path, archive size, file count, and
producer. The consumer recognizes only
`actions/download-artifact@d3f86a106a0bac45b974a628896c90dbdf5c8093`.
It scans only verified manifests from direct `needs`, requires one
exact-name match, downloads by the bound producer job UUID,
and verifies size and SHA-256 before preflighting and extracting the bounded
ZIP. Omitted `path` means workspace root; `download-path` is absolute. Digest
mismatch is fatal (stricter than upstream). GitHub URLs and metadata are not
fabricated. Exact-commit Buildkite build 270 and its independent artifact
observation prove the producer-to-two-consumer roundtrip contract.

### Canonical cache actions have experimental v2 support

Cache credentials are provisioned only for the exact canonical identities
`actions/cache`, `actions/cache/restore`, and `actions/cache/save`. The root
restore/post-save lifecycle and the restore-only and save-only forms are
supported, including when nested in verified composite actions. Cache use in a
background step (directly or anywhere in its composite action tree) and cache
use inside a job container are rejected. Forks, workspace lookalikes, unknown
paths, and third-party actions that merely use the cache toolkit do not receive
credentials.

The documented and tested minimum is v4.2.0. Refs that clearly denote v1-v3 or
a semantic version older than v4.2.0 are rejected. Moving major tags, literal
SHAs, `main`, branches, and other opaque refs are admitted without a commit
allowlist for this initial preview; the resolved commit and complete source
tree are still bound and verified. A dedicated `actions-cache` plan capability,
new immutable schema version, and tighter release/commit policy are future
hardening options rather than current guarantees.

Each main or post phase receives a fresh token and has an independent 14-minute
cap. The action is forced into v2 mode with
`ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL=https://isaacsu-ghacs.buildkite.dev/` and
`ACTIONS_CACHE_SERVICE_V2=true`; legacy cache/runtime URLs are absent. The
agent image must provide `tar`, `zstd`, and any other tools expected by the
upstream action.

Credential-bearing cache phases strip workflow-provided Node/process injection
settings (`NODE_OPTIONS`, `NODE_PATH`, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`,
`NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`, `SSLKEYLOGFILE`, `LD_PRELOAD`, and
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) and all upper- and lower-case HTTP, HTTPS, ALL, and NO proxy
variables. The runtime-owned service settings are overlaid last. Trust and
untrusted-branch decisions, cache namespaces, and read/write authorization are
owned by the token minter and cache service, not by workflow configuration or
the runner.

### Failures stay explicit

Unsupported syntax, runner labels, action types, and protected capabilities
fail closed. The bridge does not silently choose a nearby behavior.

A runtime-skipped Actions job currently appears successful to Buildkite while
publishing its logical `skipped` result. Downstream imported jobs use that
logical result. This is a UI difference until Buildkite has a scheduler-visible
skipped job state.

If producer identity or result artifact selection becomes ambiguous—for
example, after retrying an individual producer—consumers fail closed. Retry the
whole build rather than one imported job.

Cancellation targets the complete process tree: `SIGINT`, then `SIGTERM` after
7.5 seconds, then `SIGKILL` after another 2.5 seconds. GitHub uses the same
timing for the direct process, but `buildkite-gha` deliberately avoids leaving
child processes behind.

## Use the CLI directly

The [plugin](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/github-actions-buildkite-plugin)
is the recommended installation. For direct use, download
`buildkite-gha_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz` and `checksums.txt` from the matching GitHub
[release](https://github.com/buildkite/buildkite-gha/releases), verify the
archive checksum, and extract it to a stable location. The archive contains
`buildkite-gha` and `LICENSE`.

Action workflows also require mise 2026.5.12 on the importer `PATH` when
invoking `upload` directly. The runtime uses it with repository configuration
disabled to install exact Node 20.20.2 or 24.18.0 releases. Those Node binaries
require glibc 2.28 or newer; the static Go CLI does not. `validate` and
`compile` do not install Node or require mise.

### Validate

Validate the static workflow subset without an event:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Apply the production profile with human-readable or machine-readable output:

```sh
buildkite-gha validate --profile hosted-tokenless \
  --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json --format text \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml

buildkite-gha validate --profile hosted-tokenless \
  --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json --format json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Profile validation may access the public network to resolve actions. It does
not call Buildkite, install Node, or execute workflow code.

### Event snapshots

`compile` and profile validation take an explicit, bounded event snapshot:

```json
{
  "provider": "github",
  "event": "push",
  "repository": {
    "owner": "acme",
    "name": "widgets",
    "clone_url": "https://github.com/acme/widgets.git",
    "default_branch": "main"
  },
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "sha": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "actor": "octocat",
  "payload": {
    "ref": "refs/heads/main"
  }
}
```

The snapshot supplies the compile-time Actions context. Generated plans retain
the event name, repository, ref, SHA, actor, and a payload digest, but not the
payload object itself. Runtime conditions can use those retained identity fields
but cannot currently access `github.event`; an expression such as
`github.event.action` may therefore pass validation and fail when the job runs.
The snapshot is compatibility data, not proof that the event is trustworthy,
and cannot authorize a protected capability.

### Compile

Render deterministic Buildkite pipeline YAML, or inspect the compiler IR:

```sh
buildkite-gha compile --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json \
  .github/workflows/ci.yml

buildkite-gha compile --event-path .buildkite/events/current.json \
  --format ir-json .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

The pipeline output references content-addressed plans and the exact compiler
executable. `compile` is read-only: it does not materialize those artifacts or
upload a pipeline, so piping its output directly to a real Buildkite upload is
not a complete execution path.

### Upload

`upload` is the in-build command used by the plugin:

```sh
buildkite-gha upload --runtime-queue hosted .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

It requires `BUILDKITE=true` and `BUILDKITE_STEP_KEY`. Without `--event-path`,
it derives a bounded compatibility snapshot from the current Buildkite build.
With `--event-path`, it uses that explicit snapshot. Both paths remain
unattested and tokenless.

The command uploads the exact executable and content-addressed plans before
calling `buildkite-agent pipeline upload --no-interpolation --reject-secrets`.
The queue argument is intentionally fixed to `hosted`; it cannot be used to
select a more privileged queue.

`run-job` is an internal command emitted into generated jobs. Users should not
need to invoke it directly.
